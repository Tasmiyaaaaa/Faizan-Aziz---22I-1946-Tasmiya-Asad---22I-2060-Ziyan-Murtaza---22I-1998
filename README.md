   Reads JSON data and writes it onto a designated topic as messages.
## Key Aspect:
   Efficient handling of large dataset for minimal latency.
## Consumers:
## PCY Consumer:
   Frequent Itemset Mining
## Function:
  Utilizes the PCY algorithm for finding frequent itemsets in data streams.
## Output:
  Results displayed on console for monitoring.
## Apriori Consumer:
  Pattern Discovery
## Function: 
  Applies the Apriori algorithm for frequent itemset mining.
## Output:
  Results showcased on console interface.
## Real-Time Average Price Consumer
## Function:
  Calculates real-time average prices of products.
## Output:
